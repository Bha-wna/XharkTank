This project targets two type of users : Entrepreneur and Investor where Entrepreneur can post their pitch and Investor can make their offer on a particular pitch.
Created a REST API with 4 endpoints:

  -- For getting list of all the pitches
  -- For fetching a specific pitch with pitch id
  -- For making offer on a specific pitch
